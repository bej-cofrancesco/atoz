# OCaml Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Functional Programming Language Interpreter

Build a comprehensive programming language interpreter that:

- Implements lexing and parsing of source code
- Features a static type system with inference
- Provides evaluation of expressions and statements
- Implements closures and higher-order functions
- Features algebraic data types and pattern matching
- Provides module system for code organization
- Implements a standard library of common functions
- Features a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) interface
- Includes error reporting with location information
- Provides optimization passes for performance

This project will cover:

- OCaml language fundamentals
- Functional programming paradigms
- Strong static typing with type inference
- Algebraic data types and pattern matching
- Parser combinators and lexer generators
- Module system and functors
- Recursive descent parsing
- Error handling and reporting
- Environment and scope management
- Testing and validation strategies
