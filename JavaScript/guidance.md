# JavaScript Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Interactive Web Budget Tracker

Build a web-based budget tracking application that allows users to:

- Add income and expenses with categories
- Visualize spending with charts
- Filter transactions by date and category
- Calculate savings and budget goals
- Store data in the browser's localStorage (and later potentially a backend)

This project will cover:

- Core JavaScript fundamentals
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Array methods and data transformations
- Local storage
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- Data visualization with a library like Chart.js
- Modern ES6+ features
