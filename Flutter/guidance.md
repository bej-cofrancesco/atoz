# Flutter Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Cross-Platform Mobile Task Manager

Build a comprehensive task management application with Flutter:

- Create, edit, and delete tasks with priorities
- Organize tasks into categories and projects
- Set due dates and reminders for tasks
- Implement user authentication (email/password or OAuth)
- Sync data across devices with cloud storage
- Use local notifications for reminders
- Implement light and dark themes
- Add data visualization for task completion stats
- Include search functionality
- Support offline usage with local storage
- Implement custom animations for a polished UI
- Add sharing capabilities for collaborative tasks

This project will cover:

- Flutter widgets and UI components
- State management techniques (Provider, Bloc, or Riverpod)
- Navigation and routing
- Asynchronous programming with Futures and Streams
- Local data persistence with SQLite or Hive
- Firebase integration for authentication and cloud storage
- REST API consumption
- Platform-specific code integration
- Unit and widget testing
- Custom animations and transitions
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Localization for multiple languages
