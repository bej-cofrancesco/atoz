# A to Z Programming Language Challenge

A personal project documenting my journey to learn and build applications in multiple programming languages from ActionScript to Zig. Each directory contains my notes, installation guides, and project plans as I tackle each language.

## Purpose

This repository tracks my personal challenge to:

- Learn 42 different programming languages
- Build a practical application in each language
- Document the setup process and challenges encountered
- Track my progress and growth as a programmer
- Compare and contrast language paradigms and features

The primary goal is to push my skills beyond familiar territory and gain a broader understanding of programming concepts by implementing them in various languages.

## Repository Structure

For each language, I maintain:

```
LanguageName/
├── guidance.md      # My learning notes and project plans
└── installation.md  # Setup process and environment configuration
```

## Progress Tracking

As I work through each language:

1. ✅ Set up development environment (installation.md)
2. ✅ Document language basics and key concepts (guidance.md)
3. ⬜ Implement the project
4. ⬜ Reflect on challenges and lessons learned

## Motivation

This challenge helps me:

- Break out of my comfort zone with familiar languages
- Understand different programming paradigms hands-on
- Build a diverse portfolio of projects
- Develop adaptability as a programmer
- Gain insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different languages

## Personal Notes

This repository is primarily for my personal use, tracking my journey through these languages. While others might find some of these notes helpful, they reflect my own learning process and aren't intended as comprehensive tutorials.

## Acknowledgments

- The creators and communities of all these programming languages
- Documentation writers and tutorial creators whose resources help me learn
- Open-source projects that provide examples and inspiration
