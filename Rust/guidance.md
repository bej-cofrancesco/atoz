# Rust Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Command-Line Task Manager with Database Integration

Build a feature-rich task management application with:

- Command-line interface for task management
- SQLite database integration for task persistence
- Task prioritization and categorization
- Due date tracking and reminder system
- Search and filter functionality
- Data export to CSV/JSON formats
- User authentication for multi-user support
- Command history and undo/redo functionality
- Interactive TUI (Text User Interface) with keyboard shortcuts
- Plugin system for extensibility

This project will cover:

- Ownership and borrowing
- Structs, enums, and pattern matching
- Error handling with Result and Option
- Traits and generics
- Concurrency with threads and async/await
- Database interaction
- CLI argument parsing
- File I/O operations
- Unit and integration testing
- Documentation and package distribution
