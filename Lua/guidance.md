# Lua Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Game Modding and Extension Framework

Build a comprehensive game modding framework that:

- Provides a plugin system for extending game functionality
- Implements custom UI elements and widgets
- Features event-driven scripting capabilities
- Provides asset loading and resource management
- Implements save/load functionality for mods
- Features a configuration system for mod settings
- Provides debugging and logging tools
- Implements inter-mod communication
- Features hot-reloading for development
- Includes documentation generation for APIs

This project will cover:

- Lua language fundamentals
- Tables and metatables
- Functional programming techniques
- Object-oriented programming in Lua
- Coroutines for cooperative multitasking
- Module system and package management
- File I/O and serialization
- Error handling and debugging
- Performance optimization
- Integration with C/C++ (via FFI or binding)
