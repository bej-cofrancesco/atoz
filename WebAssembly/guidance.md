# WebAssembly Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Interactive 3D Graphics Engine

Build a high-performance 3D graphics engine that:

- Provides real-time rendering capabilities
- Implements procedural geometry generation
- Features physics simulation for object interactions
- Provides custom shaders for visual effects
- Supports texture mapping and lighting models
- Implements camera controls and navigation
- Allows importing 3D models from common formats
- Features optimization techniques for complex scenes
- Provides JavaScript API for integration with web applications
- Includes performance profiling and debugging tools

This project will cover:

- WebAssembly core concepts
- Memory management and optimization
- Low-level graphics programming
- Linear algebra for 3D transformations
- Integration with WebGL
- JavaScript/WebAssembly interoperability
- SIMD vector operations
- Multi-threading with shared memory
- Binary data handling and manipulation
- Performance optimization techniques
