# MATLAB Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Signal Processing and Analysis Toolkit

Build a comprehensive signal processing application that:

- Imports and processes various signal types (audio, biomedical, etc.)
- Implements time-domain and frequency-domain analysis
- Features interactive visualizations of signal characteristics
- Provides filtering and noise reduction capabilities
- Implements spectral analysis tools
- Features wavelet analysis functionality
- Includes machine learning for signal classification
- Supports batch processing of multiple signals
- Provides a customizable graphical user interface
- Generates detailed reports with analysis results

This project will cover:

- MATLAB language fundamentals
- Signal processing techniques
- Matrix operations and linear algebra
- Data visualization methods
- GUI development with GUIDE or App Designer
- Statistical analysis
- Digital filter design
- Machine learning algorithms
- Performance optimization
- Data import/export capabilities
