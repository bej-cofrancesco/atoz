# C Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Personal Library Management System

Build a command-line application for managing a personal book collection:

- Add, delete, and update book records
- Search by title, author, or genre
- Sort by different criteria (title, date, rating)
- Basic statistical analysis (number of books, average rating)
- Import/export data to/from CSV files
- User authentication system
- Data persistence using file I/O
- Memory management for efficient operation
- Command history and undo functionality
- Custom data structures for organizing information

This project will cover:

- C syntax and language fundamentals
- Pointers and memory management
- File I/O operations
- Structures and custom data types
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Command-line argument parsing
- Error handling and debugging techniques
- Modular programming and code organization
- String processing and manipulation
- Algorithms for searching and sorting
