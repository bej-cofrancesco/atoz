# Idris Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Verified Smart Contract Development Framework

Build a comprehensive smart contract development framework that:

- Implements verified contract specifications
- Features formal verification of properties
- Provides a domain-specific language for contracts
- Implements proof generation for contract correctness
- Features transaction simulation and testing
- Provides automatic invariant checking
- Implements secure multi-party computation protocols
- Features code extraction to target platforms
- Provides interactive theorem proving capabilities
- Includes documentation generation with proofs

This project will cover:

- Idris language fundamentals
- Dependent type theory
- Theorem proving techniques
- Type-driven development
- Effects and state management
- Algebraic data types
- Proof by induction
- Code generation and extraction
- DSL development
- Advanced type-level programming
