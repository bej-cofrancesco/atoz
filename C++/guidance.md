# C++ Learning Guide

## Project Idea: 3D Game Engine Core

Build a simple but functional 3D game engine that includes:

- Rendering system using OpenGL or Vulkan
- Entity-component system for game objects
- Physics simulation
- Input handling
- Asset loading and management
- Scene graph implementation
- Simple shader system
- Cross-platform support

This project will cover:

- Modern C++ (C++17/20) features
- Memory management and optimization
- Object-oriented programming principles
- Template metaprogramming
- Multi-threading and concurrency
- 3D math and linear algebra
- Graphics programming
- Design patterns
- Build systems and dependency management
