## Project Idea: Task Management API with Functional Programming

Build a RESTful API for task management that leverages Haskell's functional programming principles:

- User authentication using JWT
- CRUD operations for tasks and projects
- Task scheduling and deadlines
- Tagging and categorization
- Search and filtering functionality
- Reminders and notifications
- Data persistence with PostgreSQL
- Input validation with strong typing
- Logging and error handling
- Documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI

This project will cover:

- Functional programming concepts
- Pure functions and immutability
- Algebraic data types
- Monads and functional composition
- Type safety and inference
- Concurrency with lightweight threads
- JSON handling
- Database interaction
- Web server implementation
- Functional testing
