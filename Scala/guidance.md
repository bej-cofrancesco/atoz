# Scala Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Reactive Stock Trading Platform

Build a real-time stock trading simulation platform that:

- Connects to external API for real-time or historical market data
- Processes streaming data using reactive programming patterns
- Implements trading algorithms and strategy patterns
- Persists trade data and performance metrics
- Provides a responsive web dashboard for visualization
- Allows backtesting of trading strategies
- Features user authentication and profile management
- Implements concurrent request processing
- Includes a domain-specific language for defining trading rules
- Offers REST and WebSocket APIs

This project will cover:

- Functional programming principles
- Object-oriented programming with traits
- Immutable data structures
- Type safety and static typing
- Reactive programming with Akka Streams
- Concurrency and parallel processing
- Pattern matching
- Higher-order functions
- Type classes and implicits
- Actor model with Akka
