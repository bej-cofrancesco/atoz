## Project Idea: Personal Task Manager

Build a command-line task manager application that allows users to:

- Add, view, update, and delete tasks
- Set priorities and due dates
- Filter and sort tasks
- Save tasks to a file (JSON/CSV)
- Eventually add a simple GUI with Tkinter

This project will cover:

- Core Python syntax
- Data structures
- File I/O
- OOP concepts
- Error handling
- User input validation
- Optional: GUI development
