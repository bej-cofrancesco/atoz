# Unison Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Distributed Data Processing Pipeline

Build a comprehensive distributed data processing system that:

- Implements functional data transformation pipelines
- Features content-addressable code and data
- Provides distributed computation capabilities
- Implements fault-tolerant processing
- Features persistent data structures
- Provides incremental computation capabilities
- Implements type-safe distributed communication
- Features automatic dependency tracking
- Provides reactive data processing
- Includes visualization of data flow graphs

This project will cover:

- Unison language fundamentals
- Content-addressable programming
- Algebraic effects and handlers
- Functional programming paradigms
- Distributed systems concepts
- Type-based concurrency
- Immutable data structures
- Code versioning and dependency management
- Ability-based programming
- Deployment and scaling strategies
