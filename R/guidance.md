# R Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Data Analysis Dashboard for Public Health Data

Build a comprehensive data analysis and visualization dashboard that:

- Imports and cleans public health datasets (COVID-19, disease prevalence, etc.)
- Performs statistical analysis and modeling
- Visualizes trends and patterns with interactive plots
- Creates predictive models for disease spread
- Generates automated reports
- Provides geographic visualizations
- Features an interactive Shiny web application

This project will cover:

- R fundamentals and data structures
- Data manipulation with dplyr and tidyr
- Data visualization with ggplot2
- Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
- Time series analysis and forecasting
- Machine learning with tidymodels
- Interactive web applications with Shiny
- Geographic data visualization
- Report generation with R Markdown
- Package development
