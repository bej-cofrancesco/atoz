# Zig Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Cross-Platform File Management Utility

Build a high-performance file management utility that:

- Recursively scans and analyzes directory structures
- Identifies duplicate files using checksums
- Provides batch file renaming with pattern matching
- Implements secure file deletion capabilities
- Features file integrity verification
- Supports compression and archiving
- Provides file synchronization between directories
- Implements cross-platform filesystem operations
- Features a command-line interface with rich options
- Includes error handling and detailed logging

This project will cover:

- Zig language fundamentals
- Memory management and allocation
- Error handling with explicit error sets
- Cross-platform filesystem operations
- Binary data processing
- Command-line argument parsing
- Performance optimization techniques
- Concurrency with async/await
- Testing and debugging
- Build system and packaging
