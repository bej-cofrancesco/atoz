# Assembly Learning Guide

## Project Idea: Simple Operating System Bootloader

Build a minimal bootloader that:

- Loads from a boot sector
- Initializes basic hardware
- Prints messages to the screen
- Handles keyboard input
- Implements simple commands
- Loads additional sectors from disk
- Switches processor modes
- Sets up memory segmentation
- Transfers control to a kernel stub
- Implements basic error handling

This project will cover:

- Low-level hardware interaction
- Memory management
- CPU registers and flags
- Interrupts and I/O operations
- Boot process fundamentals
- BIOS calls and services
- Memory addressing modes
- Assembly syntax and instructions
- Binary and hexadecimal operations
- System initialization sequences
